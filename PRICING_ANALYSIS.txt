NestNomad Pricing Strategy Analysis
=====================================

1. PRICING MODEL OVERVIEW
-------------------------

  Plan          Price        Properties    Extra Properties
  ----          -----        ----------    ----------------
  Free          €0/mo        1             N/A
  Standard      €12/mo       Up to 3       +€5/mo per extra property
  Pro           €39/mo       Unlimited     N/A

All plans include full feature access: lease management, expense tracking,
issue management, payment confirmation, and tenant/landlord collaboration.


2. FREE TIER RATIONALE
-----------------------

- 1 property is enough for a landlord with a single apartment to fully
  experience the product with real data.
- No feature gating — users get the complete product. The only limit is
  the number of properties. This avoids the frustrating "upgrade to unlock"
  experience and lets users fall in love with the platform.
- Converts to paid naturally when the user acquires a second property.


3. STANDARD TIER (€12/mo) RATIONALE
-------------------------------------

- €12/mo is low enough that someone with 2-3 properties doesn't hesitate.
  It's priced below the "needs manager approval" threshold for individuals.
- The +€5/mo per extra property add-on creates a smooth scaling curve:
    - 3 properties: €12/mo (base)
    - 4 properties: €12 + (1 x €5) = €17/mo
    - 5 properties: €12 + (2 x €5) = €22/mo
    - 6 properties: €12 + (3 x €5) = €27/mo
    - 7 properties: €12 + (4 x €5) = €32/mo
    - 8 properties: €12 + (5 x €5) = €37/mo
    - 9 properties: €12 + (6 x €5) = €42/mo  <-- Pro becomes cheaper
- This add-on model means users pay proportionally to value received,
  and it creates a natural upgrade pressure toward Pro.


4. PRO TIER (€39/mo) RATIONALE
--------------------------------

- The break-even point vs Standard + extras is 9 properties:
    - At 8 properties: Standard = €12 + (5 x €5) = €37/mo vs Pro = €39/mo
    - At 9 properties: Standard = €12 + (6 x €5) = €42/mo vs Pro = €39/mo
- So at 9+ properties, Pro becomes the obvious better deal.
- This is a good crossover point — users with 9+ properties are typically
  serious landlords or small agencies who get significant value from
  the platform and are ready for an unlimited plan.
- Includes priority support as an extra incentive.


5. STANDARD → PRO SWITCH ANALYSIS
-----------------------------------

  Properties    Standard Cost    Pro Cost    Savings with Pro
  ----------    -------------    --------    ----------------
  3             €12              €39         Standard saves €27
  4             €17              €39         Standard saves €22
  5             €22              €39         Standard saves €17
  6             €27              €39         Standard saves €12
  7             €32              €39         Standard saves €7
  8             €37              €39         Standard saves €2
  9             €42              €39         Pro saves €3       <-- SWITCH POINT
  10            €47              €39         Pro saves €8
  15            €72              €39         Pro saves €33
  20            €97              €39         Pro saves €58

Users will start seriously considering Pro at 7-8 properties (only €2-7
difference). At 9 properties the switch becomes a no-brainer.


6. UPGRADE FUNNEL
-----------------

  Free (1 property)
    |
    |  User acquires 2nd property
    v
  Standard (€12/mo, up to 3 properties)
    |
    |  User grows beyond 3 properties, add-on costs accumulate
    |  At 7-8 properties, Pro is nearly the same price
    v
  Pro (€39/mo, unlimited)

Each transition is natural and value-driven. Users never feel forced —
they upgrade because the math makes sense.


7. KEY PRINCIPLES
-----------------

- Gate on PROPERTIES, not features. Properties are the natural scaling
  dimension for property management and directly correlate with value.

- Keep the free tier generous on features. Let users experience everything.
  The constraint is quantity (1 property), not quality.

- The add-on pricing (+€5/property) is the key differentiator of this model.
  It captures revenue from users between 3-8 properties who aren't ready
  for Pro, while naturally funneling larger users to the unlimited plan.

- Annual pricing (optional future addition): offer ~15-20% discount for
  annual billing to improve retention and cash flow.
    - Standard: €12/mo -> ~€120/yr (€10/mo effective)
    - Pro: €39/mo -> ~€390/yr (€32.50/mo effective)


8. REGIONAL PRICING CONSIDERATION
-----------------------------------

Since the platform supports Bosnian, Serbian (Latin & Cyrillic), consider
offering adjusted pricing for the Balkan market where purchasing power
is lower. Possible regional rates:

  Plan          Global        Balkan Market
  ----          ------        -------------
  Free          €0            €0
  Standard      €12/mo        €6-8/mo
  Pro           €39/mo        €19-25/mo

This can be implemented via geo-IP detection or manual country selection.
